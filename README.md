# POJ Fonts

See individual font folders for license information.

See [`charset.txt`](charset.txt) for a full set of test characters.

The corresponding Excel sheet `charset.xlsx` lists all characters and
Unicode points for easy reference when creating or modifying a font.

In order to maintain consistency among fonts included in this repository,
please make a copy of all combined glyphs (glyphs which comprise two
or more Unicode code points), and add [Private Use Area codepoints](unicode_pua.txt)
for use in legacy software that does not support the necessary
OpenType features.

PRs welcome!

Instructions for creating fonts can be found in the following video:
